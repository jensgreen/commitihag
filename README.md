**commitihag** is a tiny command-line utility that helps you remember to commit your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

Once per day when starting a new shell, commitihag will check `~/.dotfiles` for uncommitted changes.

If the state is dirty, commitihag will gently remind you to commit your changes:

```
commitihag found uncommitted changes in:
    ~/.dotfiles
Checking again tomorrow...
```


Usage
-----

Just start a new shell.

commitihag will leave you a message you when you need to commit. At most once per day.
